## Technologies:
### ETL & Orchestration: Apache Airflow
### Data Storage: Docker, PostgresSQL
### Exploratory Analysis: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
### Modeling: scikit-learn, XGBoost
### Visualization: Power BI 
### Version Control & Automation: GitHub + GitHub Actions

## Problem Statement:
### Small businesses represent the majority of global companies but face uncertain growth trajectories. This project aims to predict the growth potential of small and mid-sized companies by analyzing historical firmographic data.

## Goal:
### Identify which companies are most likely to enter a high-growth phase (e.g., significant increase in employee count or market expansion) within the next few years based on their characteristics and industry trends.

## Insights:

### TBD
